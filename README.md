### Implemets Matrix simulation

In this program, you can simulate a small game inspired by The Matrix. Neo’s goal is to escape the Matrix by reaching a telephone, but the mission is not easy—Agents are constantly chasing him.
Using threads, we simulate the movements of both Neo and the Agents at the same time, making the game dynamic and unpredictable.
Will Neo manage to escape through the telephone, or will the Agents catch him first?
